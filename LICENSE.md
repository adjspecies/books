# Licensing

Licening for a source code repository for manuscripts comprised of a collection of written works by various artists is, by necessity, complex.

## The works

Unless otherwise stated, each work of fiction, non-fiction, prose, or poetry is licensed by \[adjective\]\[species\], Ltd. under a Creative Commons 3.0 BY-NC-SA license.  All authors retain total copyright of their works, and \[a\]\[s\] simply retains publication license of the work.  Each work shall be maintained in a separate file, and a license statement shall accompany that file.  For further information on the CC BY-NC-SA license, please see [here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)

## But what about the code?

If there is, by some strange coincidence, a need that you have which is met by any LaTeX macros, python scripts, or any other `code` contained in this repository, then you may feel free to use it.  That code is licensed under an MIT license:

## Why?

Repositories such as these allow a maximum of transparency between editors, typesetters, programmers, and authors.  The goal of this repository in particular is to provide a publicly visible, edited, and audited view into the publication works of \[adjective\]\[species\], Ltd. when it comes to physical or electronic copy destined for publication outside of a website.
